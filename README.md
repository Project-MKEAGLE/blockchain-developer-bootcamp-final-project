The Vault

I originally had the idea of building a dapp that encouraged long-term NFT holding where a user would lock their NFT in a "vault" and they'd receive an ERC-20 token in return based on how long they decided to lock up their NFT.

But for the sake of keeping it simple, I decided to scrap the ERC-20 token reward for now. I may also simplify further by just using ETH deposits rather than an NFT.


Workflow:
1. Connect a wallet to the dapp
2. Decide on the lock up period and the asset to deposit
3. Deposit asset into the smart contract
4. Withdraw asset after the lock up period ends
